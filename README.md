# LYSO_BT

LYSO beam test to  

Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation to measure the Birks coefficient of LYSO scintillators. 
The simulation does not include quenching effect and is compared directly to sperimental data recorded colliding electrons, carbon nuclei and protons against the LYSO cristals. 
The data were collected at the Trento Proton Therapy Center and CNAO in Pavia. 

Some results obtained from this Monte Carlo simulation are descrbided in this proceeding: [Nuovo Cimento C](https://www.sif.it/riviste/sif/ncc/econtents/2023/046/04/article/37).
